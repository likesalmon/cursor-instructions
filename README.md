# Cursor Instructions

Helpful instructions for the Cursor IDE Composer.

## Usage

1. Copy rules-for-ai.md into Cursor Settings > General > Rules for AI. These are intended to be general and not taylored to any one project or tech stack.
2. Add .cursorrules to the root of your project and customize it for your tech stack. The current one is for a React Native app and not generally applicable.
3. Copy the /instructions folder to your project. When you want to use one, `@` it in the compose like `@install-eslint-8.md`.
4. Use the prompts in promps.md to improve the Composer's output. YMMV.
